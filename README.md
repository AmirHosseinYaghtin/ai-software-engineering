# AI Software Engineering ðŸ“¦

This repository is a collection of practical projects and learning exercises focused on applied AI software engineering, with an emphasis on Large Language Models (LLMs) and modern AI system development practices.

The goal is to build production-oriented AI features â€” including chatbots, RAG systems, APIs, and deployment pipelines â€” while following reliable software engineering principles.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- **LangChain Projects**: LLM-powered tools and chatbots using LangChain.
- **FastAPI Services**: Serving AI models and LLM applications through scalable, production-grade APIs.
- **Dockerized Deployments**: Containerizing AI services for reliable deployment.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Basic MLOps practices for observing, logging, and maintaining AI services.

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

To demonstrate hands-on experience building AI-powered applications with a focus on:
- Clean, maintainable software engineering practices  
- Practical LLM integration for real-world use cases  
- Deployment-ready systems with monitoring and reliability in mind
